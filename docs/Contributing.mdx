## Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) installed
- IDE or editor of choice (e.g., WebStorm, VS Code)
- Terminal of choice (e.g., Git Bash, WSL, PowerShell, Command Prompt, MacOS Terminal)
- Web browser

### Recommended
- React Dev Tools browser extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/), or [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/react-developer-tools/gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil)

### Optional
- Git GUI such as GitKraken, SourceTree, GitHub Desktop (if you prefer this over working only with terminal commands)

## Getting started

1. If you do not have write access to the repository, first fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page on GitHub.

   If you have write access, you can skip this step and create a branch within the main repository directly.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine

	For your fork:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/redback-ui.git
    ```
    For the main repository:
	```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Redback-Operations/redback-ui.git
    ```
3. Create a branch for your work, following the Capstone [Branching Guidelines](https://verdant-raindrop-f3e404.netlify.app/processes/quality-assurance/git-contributions-guide/#branching-guidelines)
    ```bash
    git branch <branch-name>
    ```
4. Check out your branch
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
5. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd path/to/redback-ui
    ```
6. Install the project dependencies
    ```bash
   npm install
    ```
7. Start Storybook and see the components and docs, including your changes, in your browser
    ```bash
    npm run storybook
    ```
## Creating a new component

[generate-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-react-cli) is set up to generate the boilerplate code required for a new component using our pre-defined templates. To create a new component, run the following command in your terminal, replacing `ComponentName` with the name of your component.

```bash
npx generate-react-cli component ComponentName
```

A new folder named with your component name will be created in the `src/components` directory, containing the following files:
- `ComponentName.tsx`: the main React component file
- `ComponentName.styled.ts`: where styles are defined, using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- `ComponentName.stories.tsx`: the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) file used to see, test, and document the component
- `ComponentName.test.tsx`: the unit test file. A basic example is included. Please add further tests as relevant to your component.

### Theme and design tokens
Design tokens are used to maintain consistency across the design system and applications that use it. The tokens are defined in a JavaScript object.

All apps/websites consuming Redback UI should define a theme with keys matching the example provided in Redback UI (i.e., of type `RedbackUiTheme`), and be wrapped in a `RedbackUiThemeProvider` component imported from Redback UI. This component is a wrapper for styled-components' `ThemeProvider` that expects the tokens we have defined.

When developing components for Redback UI, please use design tokens wherever possible rather than hard-coding values. This will ensure consistency and make it easier to apply new themes or update the design system in the future.

### Automated tests
This project is set up for unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).  Further testing types will be added as the project progresses.

To run the unit tests from your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Instructions on running tests using WebStorm's relevant IDE features will be made available as the project progresses.

## Working with documentation pages

Component documentation pages are automatically generated by the `.stories.tsx` files in the `src/components` directory.

In addition to these, custom documentation pages written in Markdown are located in the `docs` directory. `.mdx` files can contain React components, making it possible to use custom components to lay out and style documentation page content in more complex ways than basic Markdown supports, when appropriate.

Like regular components, [generate-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-react-cli) is set up to simplify the creation of new custom components for documentation pages. If you see a need to add a new component for documentation purposes, please use the generator to do so from the boilerplate templates:

```bash
npx generate-react-cli component ComponentName --type=doc
```

## Before submitting your change

Test the built version of Storybook to make sure everything works as expected, so that when your PR is approved and merged into the main branch you can be confident that you haven't introduced any errors such as incorrect file paths.

1. Build Storybook
	```bash
	npm run build
	```
2. Preview the built version locally
	```bash
	npm run preview
	```

## Submitting your change

1. Stage your changes
	```bash
	git add .
	```
2. Commit your changes to your local branch
	```bash
	git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
	```
3. Push your changes up to GitHub

	For the first time:
	```bash
	git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
	```
	For subsequent pushes:
	```bash
	git push
	```
4. Create a pull request on GitHub, ensuring your include a clear description of your changes and any relevant context for reviewers.
